# Tanks Game

A browser-based multiplayer artillery game inspired by Scorched Earth. The game allows 2â€“8 players to connect and take turns firing projectiles using angle and power inputs, with future support for wind, weapons, and terrain deformation.

## Project Setup

To get started, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Game

You can run both the frontend and backend servers with a single command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will concurrently start:
- The SvelteKit frontend on http://localhost:5173
- The Socket.IO backend server on http://localhost:3001

## Development

For separate development workflows, you can run the frontend and backend individually:

```bash
# Start just the frontend
npm run dev

# Start just the backend
npm run server
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
